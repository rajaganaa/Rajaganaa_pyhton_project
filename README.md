README.md for Scientific Calculator in Python with Tkinter

This is a README file for a scientific calculator built using Python's Tkinter library.

Features:
    •	Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
    •	Handles decimals
    •	Includes scientific functions like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, exponential, etc.
    •	Offers standard and scientific calculator layouts
    •	Displays current operation on the screen
Requirements:
    •	Python 3 (tested with Python 3.x)
    •	Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Installation:
    1.	Make sure you have Python 3 and Tkinter installed.
    2.	Clone or download this repository.
Running the Calculator:
    1.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
    2.	Navigate to the directory containing the calculator script (usually named main.py).
    3.	Run the script using the following command:python main.py

Using the Calculator:
    •	Enter numbers using the numeric buttons.
    •	Use the arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for calculations.
    •	Click the decimal point button (.) to enter decimals.
    •	Use the scientific functions buttons for advanced calculations.
    •	The current operation is displayed on the screen.
    •	Click the "Equals" button (=) to get the result of the calculation.
    •	Use the "Clear" button (C) to clear the current entry.
    •	Use the "All Clear" button (AC) to clear the entire display.
    •	The calculator offers two layouts: standard (basic operations) and scientific (advanced functions). You can switch between them using the "File" menu.
Additional Notes:
    •	Feel free to modify the code to add more functionalities or customize the appearance.
    •	This code provides a basic structure for a scientific calculator. You can extend it further based on your needs.
